## Description
This will be a way to gather language data that posts into an API. On the other side, one can search the database for patterns.

## User Stories

_As a researcher_:
    - I want the user to input summary based on a video (for now, to control variability)
    - I want the user to input language background 
    - I want the ability to query user input that has been stored in an API

_As a user_:
    - Users should be able to summarize what happened in video...
